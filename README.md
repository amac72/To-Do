# To-Do
To-Do is a full-stack web application that uses React, .NET, and MySQL. Add, change, organize, and complete tasks on your to-do list. This project was inspired by the Microsoft To Do task management app.

## Motivation
As a frequent user of the Microsoft To Do task management app, I set out to create a similiar application that maintains my favorite features and removes the features I find to be unnecessary, all while adding some personal touch.
